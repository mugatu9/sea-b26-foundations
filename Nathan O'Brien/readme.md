Born and raised in Washington, I've lived in the Seattle area my entire life. In the past couple years I've been gaining experience doing different things, trying to figure out my path in The Circus of Life, and I've recently found coding to be a promising path that I hope will work out. My hobbies include rockhounding, reading, playing handball, and hiking, among other things. I like to experience the world, and I like to experience new things(unless they suck, of course). I'm excited to be part of this program, and I hope to get a lot out of it!
