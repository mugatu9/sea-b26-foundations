####About Me

I have been a filmmaker, photographer, animator, graphic designer, salesman, and retail manager.  My longest stretch was as a retail manager and I was successful, but desired to be one who was on the forefront of technology instead of one dragged along.  This desire led me to programming.  I have been coding little bits here and there for years, but have only recently really dived in (javascript is the favorite right now.)  There is nothing that I love more than my family.  I have a beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters.  If you ask me what I'm doing on a day off 9.5 times out of 10 it will be something with my family.  I'm excited at the opportunity to really focus on learning what it takes to be an excellent programmer.
