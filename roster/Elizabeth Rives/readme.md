About Me
---------

### A Bit of Background 

I'm originally from Seattle and last year, after graduate school I returned to Seattle to work on projects for eSage Group, a systems integration and analytics consultancy. Before graduate school I worked as a product manager for *Scientific Explorer and *Elmer's Products*, developing children's educational activity kits. I learned Python through Code Fellows and am excited to pick up JavaScript.
